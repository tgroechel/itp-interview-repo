## What is a class?
- **Wikipedia:** In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods)
- **My translation:** A blueprint/template to create objects


## What is an object?
- **Wikipedia:** In Object-oriented programming, an object is an instance of a Class. Objects are an abstraction. They hold both data, and ways to manipulate the data
- **My translation:** The actual data structure made using the blueprint
