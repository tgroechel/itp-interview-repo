# WeekX: Classes and Objects
![](https://intellipaat.com/mediaFiles/2019/03/python10.png)

## Why do we need these?
```python
names = ["Gerald", "Denise", "Kai", "Lou"]
grades = [80, 90, 75, 90]

```
- What happens when I want to sort by name?

```python
names.sort()
```

## What is a class?
- **Wikipedia:** In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods)
- **My translation:** A blueprint/template to create objects


## What is an object?
- **Wikipedia:** In Object-oriented programming, an object is an instance of a Class. Objects are an abstraction. They hold both data, and ways to manipulate the data
- **My translation:** The actual data structure made using the blueprint
